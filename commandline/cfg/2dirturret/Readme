scripts for two-direction turret

lambda/4
rotates in negative direction
speed=400
full circle = 400 steps (12800 microsteps for 1/32)
35.(5) microsteps per 1 degree

turrret
rotates in positive direction
speed=1000
full circle = 200 steps (6400 mircosteps for 1/32)
six positions, so distance between positions is 1066.(6) microsteps


scripts:

Tinit - init stepper driver (run just after power on)
Tgotopos - move turret to given position (0..5)
Rgotoangle - rotate rotator to given angle (0..359 degrees)

WARNING! If LIM1=1 (i.e. one of limit switches active) but lsw activated by other device than you want move,
you won't be able to move it!

So, if you need to move turret to some position when rotator is at 0 angle, you should first remove rotator from
limit switch (at least to 30 degrees), then rotate turret and after all move rotator to given angle.
The same is for turret position 2: it always on LIM1, so to move rotator when turret is on 2 you should move
turret to any other position first, after that you will be able to rotate rotator

To check just run 
steppermove -vvvw -E3 -I11
(twice, if first run won't show you limit switches), and you will see value of LIM1.
